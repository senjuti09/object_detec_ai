# Object Detection AI


Object Detection AI is a cutting-edge technology that leverages machine learning algorithms to identify and locate objects within images or videos. By analyzing visual data, this AI assigns bounding boxes around detected objects, providing their class labels and spatial coordinates. This capability is essential for various applications, including autonomous vehicles, security systems, and image recognition tasks.

## Features
- **Accurate Object Detection:** Identifies multiple objects in real-time with high precision.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Provides spatial coordinates for each detected object.
- **Class Labels:** Assigns appropriate labels to detected objects for easy identification.
- **Versatile Applications:** Suitable for use in numerous fields such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and more.
